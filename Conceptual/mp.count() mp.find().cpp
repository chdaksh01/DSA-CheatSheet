/*
    The map::count() is a built-in function in C++ STL which returns 1 if the element with key K is present 
    in the map container. It returns 0 if the element with key K is not present in the container.

/*
    The map::find() is a built-in function in C++ STL that returns an iterator or a constant iterator that 
    refers to the position where the key is present in the map. 
    If the key is not present in the map container, it returns an iterator or a constant iterator which 
    refers to map.end()

    // Syntax: 
    iterator = map_name.find(key)
          or 
    constant iterator = map_name.find(key)

    //HOW TO USE
    if(m.find(s1)!=m.end()){
      //if the element is found before the end of the map
    --> followed by required code!
