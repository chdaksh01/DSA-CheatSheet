Converting Number to String in C++
There are 4 major methods to convert a number to a string, which are as follows:

1. Using to_string() IMPORTANTTTT - Idk any other method currently, ASCII thing doesn't work
2. Using string Stream
3. Using sprintf() function
4. Using boost lexical cast

Converting String to Number in C++
-> iterate character wise, do 'num' - '0' and build the number by multiplying digits with their respective powers of 10.
